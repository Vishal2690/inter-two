    <h3>01. What is box-sizing?</h3>
    <p>Box-sizing property defines how the width and height gets applied on an element.
        Default value of box-sizing is content-box, in this case the actual width of the box
        will be equal to the border and padding and width of the box ( Actual width : width
        + border + padding ).
        In case when box-sizing is set to be border-box, then the actual width will be equal
        to the width of the box itself. Means if we will increase the padding or border of
        the box then it will not increase the width of the box.</p>
    <p>a) content-box (Default)</p>
    <p>b) border-box</p>
    <div class="box-one">Content box</div>
    <div class="box-two">border box</div>

    <h3>02. What is animation-delay?</h3>
    <p>It is a sub-property of CSS animation. It defines how long the animation has to
        wait before starting. Using the animation-delay property, you define the delay by
        specifying the number of seconds or milliseconds it should take before playing.</p>

    <div id="animate"></div>

    <h3>03. Which property will you use to merge cells horizontally in a grid?</h3>
    <p>grid-column-start and grid-column-end property can be used to merge cells
        vertically. It also has a shorthand i.e., grid-column: start/end. If you want to merge
        two elements in row then we will have to use grid-row property inside the child
        element. Remember these properties are applicable only to child elements not to
        parent elements</p>

    <div class="container-f">
        <div class="item1 text"></div>
        <div class="item1 text1"></div>
        <div class="item1 text2"></div>
        <div class="item1 text3"></div>
        <div class="item1 text4"></div>
        <div class="item1 text5"></div>
    </div>

    <h3>04. Which property you will use to merge cells vertically in grid?</h3>
    <p>grid-row-start and grid-row-end property can be used to merge cells vertically. It
        also has a shorthand i.e., grid-row: grid-row-start/grid-row-end;</p>

    <div class="container-e">
        <div class="test test1"></div>
        <div class="test test2"></div>
        <div class="test test3"></div>
        <div class="test test4"></div>
        <div class="test test5"></div>
        <div class="test test6"></div>

    <h3>05. What is a Box-model?</h3>
    <p>The box model in CSS is a set of rules that determine how your web page is
        rendered on the internet. In this model, a rectangular box is generated for HTML
        elements. This box consists of first content, then padding, then border, and finally
        margin.</p>

    <h3>06. What is the difference between display none and visibility hidden?</h3>
    <p>display: none;</p>
    <p>The display: none property is used to hide elements without deleting them. It
        does not take up any space.</p>
    <p> In this case, the tag is removed from the page, which allows other elements
        to fill in.
    </p>
    <p>visibility: hidden;</p>
    <p>The visibility: hidden property also hides an element, but affects the layout
        i.e., it takes up the space.
    </p>
    <p>The element is hidden from view but not the page flow</p>
